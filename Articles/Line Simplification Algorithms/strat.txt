Data :
- Random
- Dataset
- IoT device
- tracking object API
- 2D or 3D ? (It has an impact on the following)

Proof of concept :
- Simulate a stream of data
- Evaluate the algorithm based on time and criteria describe in state of the art
- Run in an controlled setup
- Implementation of static algorithm and existing streaming algorithm (SQUISH)

Implementation :
- Connect to MobilityDB
- Use of Streaming technology (Kafka,Spark,Kinesis,...)
